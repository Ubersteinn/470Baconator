CSCE 470 Project: The Baconator
By: Nick Rubenstein and Stephen Dawkins

All code is in C# and can be ran in Visual Studio 2010.

ActorsFileParser.cs		Takes the .list files from the IMDB repo and converts them into .txt files we can use easier.
				Note: TV shows and movies are removed as well as any actor that only appears in TV show or movies

LoadActorFilmsInMemory.cs	Reads in files in the format the ActorsFileParser.cs outputs to store in memory.
